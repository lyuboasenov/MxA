# HX711

If HX711 module is used, it should be "upgraded" to boost it sampling rate and make it 3v3 compatible.

1. To make the module 3v3 compatible the R1 feedback voltage divider resistor should be substituted from 20K to 10K.
2. GND pin should be connected to either E- pin or to HX711's pin 5.
3.
